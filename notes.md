#### BUGS:

- Rewind is very laggy on some videos
- forward and rewind doesn't work on some videos

#### TODO:

- check clipping logic - currently in the PCA channel in video_roi_recorder2, we apply clipping twice. Is this necessary? should we apply normalization for the first one instead? or normalization in both instances instead?

#### Video website
https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/

- If you get a raw file webpage while trying to download a video, right click on the page and choose 'Save as', and then download the video as a .y4m
- If you try to download a video and get a .txt file, you can just change the extension to .y4m
