#### BUGS:

- Rewind is very laggy on some videos
- forward and rewind doesn't work on some videos

#### TODO:

- eigenvec button (see below)
- PCA currently is a bit slow because we are calculating eigenvectors and covariance matrices for every single frame. We can speed it up by using a eigenvector/covariance matrix cache and only update them in intervals.

#### Video website
